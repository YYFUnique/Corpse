	\brief This module provides common functions for HTTP servers/clients.

	<b>&lt;Transfer Modes&gt;</b><BR>
	The DLNAv1.0 guidelines did not define transfer modes, 
	but the guidelines assume that all audio and audio/video files 
	are transmitted with Streaming rules and all images are transmitted 
	with Interactive. A key impact of this decision is that HTTP clients 
	that attempted to use TCP flow control ran the risk of causing buffer 
	overflows on the HTTP server. DLNA eventually approved v1.0 errata 
	that defined the <i>http-stalling</i> flag. This flag (indicated in the 4th 
	field of protocolInfo) indicates whether or not HTTP clients can use 
	TCP flow control without any risk.

	The DLNAv1.5 guidelines assume that all audio and audio/video files 
	must support the Streaming transfer mode to ensure backwards compatibility 
	with DLNAv1.0. Likewise, images must also support the Interactive transfer mode.
	
	A major change for DLNAv1.5 is that HTTP clients can issue requests so that the 
	transfer mode indicates a lower priority, where the priority model is 
	(<i>Streaming</i> &gt; <i>Interactive</i> &gt; <i>Background</i>). 
	HTTP clients can know if a particular transfer mode is supported by 
	parsing the <i>DLNA.ORG_FLAGS</i> parameter in the 
	4th field of protocolInfo (often acquired through a <b>HEAD</b> request that uses the 
	<b>getcontentFeatures.dlna.org</b>) and checking if the <i>tm-s</i>, <i>tm-i</i>, 
	and <i>tm-b</i> bits are set. For all transfer modes, the <i>http-stalling</i> flag 
	only applies to <i>Streaming</i> transfers, since the actual throughput for 
	<i>Interactive</i> or <i>Background</i> is never guaranteed.

	For more information about specific transfer modes, see \ref DH_TransferModes.
	<BR><b>&lt;/Transfer Modes&gt;</b>

	<b>&lt;DLNA HTTP Headers&gt;</b><BR>
	All of the method names that begin with <b>DH_AddHeader</b> are used to 
	add HTTP headers to an HTTP request or response.

	As a general rule, HTTP Servers and HTTP Clients conforming to v1.5 can use headers 
	defined to v1.5 without negative impact to endpoints conforming to v1.0. 
	The key thing is that a v1.5 that uses any features (including any HTTP header) 
	defined in v1.5 must also implement all other mandatory requirements for v1.5. 
	This means that you cannot build something that claims v1.0 conformance that uses 
	v1.5 features. 

	The 4th field of protocolInfo is used to indicate which HTTP headers are supported by an 
	HTTP server. Essentially, HTTP clients are supposed to issue HTTP HEAD requests with 
	the <b>getcontentFeatures.dlna.org</b> header and parse the 4th field before attempting 
	to use associated features. Likewise, HTTP servers must respond to those HTTP <b>HEAD</b>
	requests by including the <b>contentFeatures.dlna.org</b> header.
	<BR><b>&lt;/DLNA HTTP Headers&gt;</b>

	<b>&lt;Future Work&gt;</b><BR>
	- Define a mechanism to easily parse the 4th field for supported features.
		(e.g. easily determine if http-stalling, tm-i, tm-s, tm-b are true. When
		this is done, be sure to take into account that bits in the flags-param sometimes
		have inferred values of true|false|unknown when the flags-param is omitted.)

	<BR><b>&lt;/Future Work&gt;</b>

/*!	\brief DLNA-defined maximum total size for HTTP header buffers.

	DLNA guidelines only require HTTP endpoints to understand the first 4K of HTTP headers.
	HTTP clients and servers can use larger header sizes, but the receiving endpoint is not
	required to interpret any of the HTTP headers that are past the 4K mark.

	An HTTP client application is expected to probe a URI with an HTTP <b>HEAD</b> request that

	If an HTTP server application supports both <b>TimeSeekRange.dlna.org</b> and

/*!	\brief Adds the <b>scid.dlna.org</b> HTTP header to a set of HTTP headers.
	
	- Used in HTTP <b>GET</b> responses to indicate the associated <i>UPnP AV Connection ID</i> 
		assigned by the UPnP AV MediaServer. This is used when the MediaServer implements DLNA's 
		<i>basic connection management</i> feature.
	- Also used in HTTP <b>GET</b> requests to indicate the request is associated with the same user-session 
		(i.e. <i>UPnP AV Connection</i>) of a previous request.
	- Also used in HTTP <b>HEAD</b> requests to extend the validity of the UPnP AV Connection ID when idling a UPnP AV connection.
	- <b>4th field note:</b> Not related to the 4th field. 
		See the DLNA guidelines related to <i>basic connection management</i> (i.e. search for “BCM?.
	- <b>DLNA version note:</b> Valid only for DLNA v1.5.

	An HTTP client application is expected to provide the server's connection-id value
	by using the value provided from the <b>scid.dlna.org</b> header from a 
	previous HTTP response for the same target URI and user playback session.

	An HTTP server application uses this header when it serving for a DMS
	or M-DMS with the <i>basic connection management</i> feature. A DMS or M-DMS
	that supports <i>basic connection management</i> is expected to do
	the following.
	- A request without the <b>scid.dlna.org</b> header causes the DMS/M-DMS
	to create a new <i>UPnP AV Connection ID</i>. The value of this connection-id
	is specified in the HTTP response as the value of the <b>scid.dlna.org</b> header.
	- A request with the <b>scid.dlna.org</b> header causes the DMS/M-DMS
	to interpret the request as being a continuation of HTTP transport layer
	activity for the indicated connection-id.

	\note Whenever possible, HTTP clients should specify this field when a
	subsequent HTTP request is for the same URI as a previous request and the 
	subsequent HTTP request serves to provide a continuation of a user experience
	provided by the earlier HTTP request. For example, if an HTTP client issues
	multiple HTTP <b>GET</b> requests using the <b>RANGE</b> HTTP header in a series to produce
	a trick-mode playback effect, then the HTTP client should
	- acquire the value of the <b>scid.dlna.org</b> HTTP header from the first HTTP response 
	- and specify the same value for the <b>scid.dlna.org</b> header in the subsequent HTTP requests.

	\param[in] http_headers The set of HTTP headers, acquired from \a ILibCreateEmptyPacket().
	\param[in] connection_id The value of the connection-id, acquired from a previous HTTP response.
