/*!	\brief Allows the application to respond to an HTTP <b>GET</b> or <b>HEAD</b> request by specifying a local file for response.
	
	The application is responsible for doing the following.
	- examining \a header->DirectiveObj to determine the requested URI
	- providing the path for the local file that the URI corresponds to the requested URI
	- providing the mime-type and protocolInfo 4th field information (i.e. contentFeatures.dlna.org value) for the URI
	- providing a URI for an IFO file (if necessary)
	- providing a callback for handling the response

	This method will handle the following HTTP headers in the following ways.
	- <b>RANGE</b> : If the request specified a RANGE header, then the response will include a CONTENT-RANGE header.
		Furthermore, the DlnaHttpServer module will appropriately send the entity-body bytes that correspond to
		the data in the CONTENT-RANGE header.
	- <b>transferMode.dlna.org</b> : If the request omits the transferMode.dlna.org HTTP header, then the response
		will be sent with the \a default_transfer_mode, specified by the application. (The application is responsible
		for specifying the proper transfer mode based on DLNA requirements.) If the request includes the
		transferMode.dlna.org, then the DlnaHttpServer will respond with the specified transfer mode if the
		mode is supported. Otherwise, the DlnaHttpServer will respond with a 406 (Not Acceptable).
	- <b>getcontentFeatures.dlna.org</b> : If the request includes the "getcontentFeatures.dlna.org:1" HTTP header,
		then the response will include the contentFeatures.dlna.org HTTP header with a value of 
		\a content_features. If the request includes the getcontentFeatures.dlna.org with a value
		other than <i>1</i>, the response is 400 (Bad Request).
	- <b>pragma: getifoFileURI</b> : If the "pragma" HTTP header includes the "getifoFileURI.dlna.org" token,
		then the response will include the ifoFileURI.dlna.org HTTP header with the \a ifo_uri specified
		as the value.

	\note Generally, the \a min_transfer_mode for all content is \ref DH_TransferMode_Bulk, with live content
	being the notable exception. The \a default_transfer_mode for most content is as follows.
	- \ref DH_TransferMode_Streaming : for immediate rendering of audio or video content
	- \ref DH_TransferMode_Interactive : for immediate rendering of images or playlist files
	- \ref DH_TransferMode_Bulk : for upload or download of all content that is not paced by the server

	\param[in] session The HTTP webserver session, obtained from the \a ILibWebServer_Session_OnSession callback
	that was specified in the \a ILibWebServer_Create method.
	\param[in] pool The ILibThreadPool object to use to read from the file.
	\param[in] header The HTTP headers that were specified in the request, obtained from the \a ILibWebServer_Session_OnSession callback
	that was specified in the \a ILibWebServer_Create method.
	\param[in] buffer_size The buffer size to use when reading from the disk and sending on the wire.
	\param[in] file_name The local file to use for the response.
	\param[in] supported_transfer_mode The union set of supported transfer mode that the request may specify in the transferMode.dlna.org HTTP header.
	\param[in] mime_type The mime-type for file, as specified in the DLNA specification.
	\param[in] content_features The 4th field of the protocolInfo for the URI.
	\param[in] ifo_uri The URI to the IFO file. Required only when the \a file_name is for MPEG2-PS content with SCR/PTS discontinuities.
	\param[in] user_obj Application-level user object to associate with the transfer.
	\param[in] callback_response The callback to execute when an error or completion occurs.
	\returns The \ref DH_TransferStatus that allows the application to track the progress of the transfer.

/*!	\brief Allows the application to save an HTTP <b>POST</b> request to a local file.

	The application is responsible for doing the following.
	- examining \a header->DirectiveObj to determine the requested URI
	- determine whether the local file can append the received data 
	(i.e. Did the HTTP server detect a failed upload attempt for
	the URI on a previous <b>POST</b> transaction for a &lt;res&gt;
	element that was created with the res\@resumeUpload attribute?)
	- providing the path for the local file that should receive the content data
	- providing the mime-type and protocolInfo 4th field information (i.e. contentFeatures.dlna.org value) for the URI
	- providing a callback for handling the response

	\param[in] file_name The local file that should receive the uploaded content.
	\param[in] append_flag Zero value indicates \a file_name will be overwritten. 
	Non-zero value indicates that the uploaded data can be appended to the
	existing data of \a file_name. Generally,
	- If \a append_flag !=0 and the \a header 
	indicates that <b>CONTENT-RANGE</b> is being used to upload partial data,
	then the method will append the received data to \a file_name.
	- If \a append_flag ==0 and the request specifies <b>CONTENT-RANGE</b>,
	then the method will respond with a 406 (Not Acceptable) error.
	\param[in] user_obj Application-level user object to associate with the transfer.
	\param[in] callback_response The callback to execute when an error or completion occurs.
