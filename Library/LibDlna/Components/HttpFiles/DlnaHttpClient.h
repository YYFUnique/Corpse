	- Issue an HTTP HEAD request that acquires the available data ranges for use with RANGE and TimeSeekRange.dlna.org (under the Limited Random Access Data Availability model).
	- Issue an HTTP HEAD request that acquires the URI for IFO file, if available.

	and save the returned data to a local file path.

	\note Given the asynchronous nature of the call, the application is responsible for the 
	lifetime of the \a request and its associated data.
	The best time to free the \a request and (if necessary, its member fields) is the handler for
	the \a callback_response.

	\param[in] request_manager The \a ILibWebClient_RequestManager instance that was created through \a ILibWebClient_Create.
	\param[in] pool The ILibThreadPool object to use to read from the file.
	\param[in] file_path The file path where the data is saved.
	\param[in] append_flag 
	Zero value means that the data overwrites the existing file indicated by \a file_path.
	-1 value means that the data is appended to the indicated \a file_path
	Positive integer value means that the data is appended to the indicated \a file_path at the specified position
	by doing the following.
	- Before issuing the HTTP request, the method will examine the current
	file length of \a file_path.
	- The method will attempt to use the <b>RANGE</b> header to transfer the file
	from the next byte index.
	- The received data is appended to \a file_path.
	\param[in] target_uri The URI that is to be downloaded. 
	The URI is assumed to have proper HTTP-escaping for DLNA.
	\param[in] requestedTransferMode The transfer mode to request for the transfer. 
	\param[in] user_obj Associate the \a user_obj with the returned \ref DH_TransferStatus.
	\param[in] callback_response Upon completion or error, execute this callback.

	Negative value means that the HTTP client will upload with intent to overwrite 
	any existing content data that is saved at the specified URI.
	Non-negative value means that the HTTP client will attempt to transfer from
	this resume position (i.e. \a resume_pos should equal the res\@uploadedSize

	&lt;res&gt; element with the res\@resumeUpload="1" and the DMS must also
	indicate support for the <i>resume content transfer</i> operation by
	having responded with metadata that preserved the res\@resumeUpload attribute.
	\param[in] requestedTransferMode The transfer mode to request for the transfer. 
	\param[in] mime_type The mime-type for file, as specified in the DLNA specification.
	\param[in] content_features The 4th field of the protocolInfo for the URI.
