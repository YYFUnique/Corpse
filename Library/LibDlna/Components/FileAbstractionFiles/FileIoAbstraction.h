 * This wraps a few simple tasks that are different between platforms. 
 * Most of it focuses on the file system calls that are completely 
 * different on POSIX, Windows and Pocket PC.
 * PocketPC is probably the most different since all of the calls have
 * to be made using wide character arrays (16 bit chars). So code was
 * added to convert multibyte (UTF-8) to wide.
